# Information

**This is the first official version of the ArcaneClientAPI, which was originally going to be included <br> in a KitPvP core plugin, but instead was made seperate, and edited from an official source.**

# Credits

<h4>All credits go to CheatBreaker LLC, FrozenOrb LLC, Moonsworth LLC, and anyone that worked on the officially released CheatBreakerAPI and LunarClientAPI, as this these are just those but with Arcane Client's unique client string (AC-Client, CheatBreaker's is CB-Client, and so on.)</h4>
