# Aero Client Bukkit API
The AeroClientAPI will allow you to detect when a player is running Aero Client, enable and disable HUD modules, allow x-ray for your staff, and much more.

## Compatibility

This API has been tested with Spigot 1.7.10, PaperSpigot 1.7.10 and mSpigot 1.7.10 (MineHQ Spigot).

This API can detect people on Aero Client 1.7.10 and 1.8.9.

**Please note** that you must add ProtocolLib to your server for the API to work! You can get the latest one for 1.7.10 [here](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/releases/tag/3.7.0).
